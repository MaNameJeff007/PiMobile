# Charts Demo

The [Codename One Charts package](https://www.codenameone.com/javadoc/com/codename1/charts/package-summary.html) is a derivative of the [aChartEngine Android library](http://www.achartengine.org/) and this demo is a port of the original aChartEngine demo to the Codename One API's. 

One of the highlights of this demo is the different look it has for Tablet/Phone modes where it implicitly adapts to the specific devices.
